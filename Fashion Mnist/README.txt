What is Fashion_Mnist Project? 

Fashion MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images, consisting of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image associated with a label from 10 classes. This project aims to build, train, and evaluate a neural network model using TensorFlow to classify these fashion items.

A Fashion MNIST machine learning project typically involves using the Fashion MNIST dataset to train machine learning models, particularly for image classification tasks. The goal is to develop algorithms that can accurately classify images of various clothing items into their respective categories, such as T-shirts, trousers, dresses, shoes, and more.

Objectives
To preprocess the Fashion MNIST dataset.
To build a neural network model using TensorFlow.
To train the model on the training dataset.
To evaluate the model on the test dataset.
To visualize the results.
