Color Detection App â€“ Streamlit + OpenCV

This project is a simple yet powerful Color Detection Web App built using Streamlit and OpenCV. The app allows users to detect primary 
colors â€” Red, Green, Blue, and optionally All Colors except White â€” from live camera feed or uploaded images. It highlights detected color areas 
with bounding boxes and provides options to adjust HSV thresholds, view FPS, and download processed output.
